Once again not sure how much of this you want. Basically it shows that there is nothing in that folder and git repository that is tracked at the moment.

    Untracked files:

            README.md
            answers.md
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Answer 5:
    On branch master
    
    No commits yet
    
    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
            new file:   README.md
    
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

            answers.md
